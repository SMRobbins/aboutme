            I am a 2nd year Graphic Designer with a strong interest in informational design, illustration, and web, with a hunger to create my own business. My hobbies include travelling, painting, and making tea and then forgetting about it. I have a B.A [h] in Visual Arts and Art History/Visual Cultures and moved to Ireland a few months after graduating to learn more about the world and what I wanted to do with my career. Four years later, I found myself walking across Spain, and it was there (half way up a mountain, cursing myself for taking the hard route) that I came to the conclusion I was going to become a Graphic Designer. Two years later, I take pleasure in the homework I am given, and have started my own side business. I have never felt more right then where I am now.
